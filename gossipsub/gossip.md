# Gossipsub Testnet

This example shows how to deploy 4 Gossipsub nodes and 1 Orchestra node on a test network.

### Private Key Generation
The following tool was used to generate the keys used in this test: https://github.com/agencyenterprise/pem-utils. This tool provides utility to create pem files and IPFS id's from them. The private keys in the `pems` directory are pre-generated keys using this tooling.
